 Decision Tree Classifier Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data. The task is part of my Data Science internship at SkillCraft Technology.

The dataset used for this project includes various features that capture customers' characteristics, enabling a robust analysis and prediction.

Dataset Details

Source: Provided during the internship

File: bank.csv

Features:

Demographics: Age, Gender, etc.

Behavioral: Spending Score, Income, etc.

Target Variable: Purchase (Yes/No)

Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing:

2. Handling missing values

3. Encoding categorical variables

4. Feature scaling and normalization

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

6. Visualized relationships between features

7 Identified significant predictors

Model Building:

Used sklearn to implement the Decision Tree Classifier

Performed train-test split for validation

Model Evaluation:

Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Visualized the decision tree structure for interpretability

Key Learnings

Improved my skills in supervised learning and model evaluation.

Gained practical experience in handling real-world datasets and implementing machine learning pipelines.

Developed a better understanding of decision tree interpretability.

Tools and Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Acknowledgments
